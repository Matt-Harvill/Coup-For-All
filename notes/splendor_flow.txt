},

Turn options:

- Take 3 gems (all different colors)
- Take 2 gems (same color) - must be 4 of that type
- Reserve a card (possibly take yellow token too)
- Buy card from board or hand
- (Auto) Take a noble if requirements are satisfied
  - Requires user input if player can get two different nobles

We could add things to the current version of Splendor:

- Make random cards based on a distribution of requirements (each game set is unique)
- Make game point goal determined at game creation

General notes:

- Don't update DB until turn is over, including noble acquisition (for now)
- Reuse a lot of the items from the coup lobby but change colors/fonts to make it distinguishable
- Set up flow to make creation of new splendor games pretty easy
