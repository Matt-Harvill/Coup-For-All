Coup Game - has a number of players - initially set by the creator, can be modified during creation

When it's created, host gets 2 coins and blank roles

When players join they also get the same thing


Once the game starts, the roles are assigned to everyone, and players are placed in a queue
For each turn someone is popped off the queue and pushed onto the end of the queue

When it is someone's turn, they have 1 minute to make a move. A timer - progress bar type display (or digital number first) - will
show them how much time they have to make a move. If they don't make a move, a move will be made for them automatically
If they are inactive for two round in a row, they will be kicked and their roles will be flipped to show to everyone

All communication will go through the socket



On the frontend - clear up the page changes with auth stuff - its doing weird stuff

Also clean up the backend - clear up how the user object is stored in the socket session


- Add leave game capability
