Once the game starts, the roles are assigned to everyone, and players are placed in a queue
For each turn someone is popped off the queue and pushed onto the end of the queue

If they don't make a move, a move will be made for them automatically
If they are inactive for two round in a row, they will be kicked and their roles will be flipped to show to everyone

When someone does an action that can be contested - pauses their turn. Once it is resolved (with the action
completing), they either get to continue or they have to end their turn.
