# Coup For All
### A responsive (mobile friendly) web app to play real-time Coup games with friends!

This code can be minimally modified (connect to a MongoDB cloud database and Heroku-like server) for a public game website like mine [here](https://coup-for-all-8b5265fb626c.herokuapp.com/).

This app uses a ReactJS frontend, NodeJS backend, and MongoDB cloud database. The user interface was designed from scratch, so I hope you like it! If not, it shouldn't be too difficult to modify.
